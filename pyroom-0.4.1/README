====== PyRoom Project ======

PyRoom is a fullscreen simple text editor, without a toolbar, a menubar or
anything that would distract the user from his most important task: writing.

===== Dependencies =====

PyRoom depends on Python, PyGTK and XDG bindings for Python (python-xdg. Please
refer to your system documentation for information on how to install these
modules if they're not currently available.

====== Optional dependencies ======

In order to use GNOME default fonts in PyRoom, gconf bindings (python-gconf)
are recommended.

If you're installing manually from our tarball and want to use PyRoom in your
own language, you'll need to install gettext.

===== Installing and Running =====

PyRoom is available as a distutils enabled package. Installation procedures
for those are easy:

Either unpack the tarball 
    
    $ tar xvfz pyroom*.tar.gz

or check out our bazaar branch for a development version (we try to keep those
unbroken and ready for production use)
    
    $ bzr branch lp:pyroom

From there, you can either run pyroom from commandline

    $ cd pyroom/
    $ ./pyroom

Or install it system wide

    $ cd pyroom
    $ python setup.py install # as root
    $ pyroom
